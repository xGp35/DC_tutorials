# Reviewing your co-worker's code

Your co-worker is asking you to review some code that they've written and give them some tips on how to get it ready for production. You know that having a docstring is considered best practice for maintainable, reusable functions, so as a sanity check you decide to use this `has_docstring()` function on all of their functions.

```python
def has_docstring(func):
    """Check to see if the function 
    `func` has a docstring.

    Args:
        func (callable): A function.

    Returns:
        bool
    """
    return func.__doc__ is not None
```
