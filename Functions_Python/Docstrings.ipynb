    "You've decided to write the world's greatest open-source natural language processing Python package. It will revolutionize working with free-form text, the way `numpy` did for arrays, `pandas` did for tabular data, and `scikit-learn` did for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function you write is `count_letter()`. It takes a string and a single letter and returns the number of times the letter appears in the string. You want the users of your open-source package to be able to understand how this function works easily, so you will need to give it a docstring. Build up a Google Style docstring for this function by following these steps."

The team wants to add a feature that displays a tooltip with a function's docstring whenever the user starts typing the function name. That way, the user doesn't have to go elsewhere to look up the documentation for the function they are trying to use. You've been asked to complete the build_tooltip() function that retrieves a docstring from an arbitrary function.\n",
