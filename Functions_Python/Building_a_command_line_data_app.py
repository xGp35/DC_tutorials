# Building a command line data app

# You are building a command line tool that lets a user interactively explore a dataset. We've defined four functions: mean(), std(), minimum(), and maximum() that users can call to analyze their data. Help finish this section of the code so that your users can call any of these functions by typing the function name at the input prompt.

# Note: The function get_user_input() in this exercise is a mock version of asking the user to enter a command. It randomly returns one of the four function names. In real life, you would ask for input and wait until the user entered a value.

# Add the missing function references to the function map
function_map = {
  'mean': mean,
  'std': std,
  'minimum': minimum,
  'maximum': maximum
}

data = load_data()
print(data)

func_name = get_user_input()

# Call the chosen function and pass "data" as an argument
function_map[func_name](data)

#To pass a function as an argument to another function, you had to determine which one you were calling and which one you were referencing. Keeping those straight will be important as we dig deeper into this chapter.

# Returning functions for a math game
# You are building an educational math game where the player enters a math term and your program returns a function that matches that term. For instance, if the player types "add", your program returns a function that adds two numbers. So far you have written functions for add, subtract, and multiply. Now you want to include a function for division.

# Your task is to write a function that takes in a math term and returns the correct function.
def create_math_function(func_name):
  if func_name == 'add':
    def add(a, b):
      return a + b
    return add
  elif func_name == 'subtract':
    # Define the subtract() function
    def subtract(a, b):
      return a - b
    return subtract
  else:
    print("I don't know that one")
