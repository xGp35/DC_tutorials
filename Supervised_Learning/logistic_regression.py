# Building a logistic regression model

# In this exercise, you will build a logistic regression model using all features in the diabetes_df dataset. The model will be used to predict the probability of individuals in the test set having a diabetes diagnosis.

# The diabetes_df dataset has been split into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test, and preloaded for you.
